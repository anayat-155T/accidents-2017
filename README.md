Traffic accidents remain a persistent threat on American roads. In 2020, an estimated 38824 people lost their lives in motor vehicle crashes, and millions more were injured. This analysis seeks to understand the underlying causes of these incidents to develop effective preventative measures. By examining traffic accident data, we aim to identify contributing factors and patterns, ultimately reducing the devastating impact of these tragedies.
